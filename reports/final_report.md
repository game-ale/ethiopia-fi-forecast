## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents the final outputs of the **Ethiopia Financial Inclusion Forecasting System**. By integrating supply-side infrastructure data with demand-side Findex surveys, we have modeled the trajectory of financial inclusion through 2027.

**Key Conclusion**: Ethiopia is on track to break the **60% Account Ownership** threshold by late 2026, driven by the "Digital First" transition where platform-based payments are replacing cash. Our base-case model projects **60.41%** ownership by 2027, with a potential upside to **61.16%** if Open Banking reforms are fully implemented.

## 2. Methodology

Our approach moved beyond simple trend extrapolation by incorporating **Event Impact Modeling**:

1.  **Data Enrichment**: We augmented the core dataset with critical enablers like **Smartphone Penetration (29.5%)** and **4G Coverage**.
2.  **Event Modeling**: We quantified the "shocks" from major historical events (e.g., Telebirr Launch, M-Pesa Entry) to calibrate future impacts.
3.  **Scenario Forecasting**: We projected 2025-2027 outcomes under three conditions:
    *   **Base Case**: Status quo trend + moderate policy implementation.
    *   **Optimistic**: Full realization of "Open Banking" and "FX Liberalization" benefits.
    *   **Pessimistic**: Macroeconomic headwinds delaying infrastructure deeper into rural areas.

## 3. Retrospective: Key Insights (2014-2024)

### A. The "Digital Dominance" Milestone
In a historic shift, the volume of digital P2P transfers has surpassed ATM cash withdrawals (Ratio: **1.08**). Ethiopia has effectively leapfrogged the "card era" directly to mobile-based payments.

### B. The Ownership Paradox
Despite 54M+ registered mobile money accounts, unique account ownership grew slowly (46% → 49%) between 2021-2024.
*   **Root Cause**: High rate of "multi-homing" (banked users opening wallets) rather than unbanked uptake.
*   **Implication**: Future growth must come from the "Usage-Coverage Gap"—converting the 21% of mobile internet users who are not yet financially active.

## 4. Forecast Results (2025-2027)

### Target: Account Ownership Rate
Our model predicts a re-acceleration of growth in 2025 as the combined effects of M-Pesa's market maturity and the new NBE Open Banking framework take hold.

| Year | Pessimistic | **Base Case** | Optimistic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 54.24% | **54.49%** | 54.74% |
| **2026** | 56.95% | **57.45%** | 57.95% |
| **2027** | 59.66% | **60.41%** | 61.16% |

> **Analyst Note**: Crossing the 60% mark in 2027 aligns with the revised NFIS-II mid-term targets, suggesting that current policy levers are effective but require sustained execution.

## 5. Event Impact Analysis

Our **Event-Indicator Matrix** identified the Drivers of Change:
1.  **High Impact**: *Telebirr Launch (2021)* - Validated as the primary driver of the 2021-2024 active user surge.
2.  **Medium Impact**: *NBE Open Banking (2025)* - Projected to drive the next wave of "Usage" depth (merchant payments, credit).
3.  **Low Impact**: *ATMs* - Infrastructure saturation reached; incremental ATMs show diminishing returns on inclusion.

## 6. Strategic Recommendations

To ensure the **Optimistic Scenario (61.16%)** is realized, the Consortium should focus on:

1.  **Bridge the Device Gap**: Smartphone penetration (29.5%) is the hard ceiling for advanced services. Financing schemes for low-cost 4G handsets are critical.
2.  **Leverage Digital ID (Fayda)**: Integrate Fayda eKYC into all wallet on-boarding to reduce the cost of customer acquisition for the rural unbanked.
3.  **Merchant Interoperability**: While P2P is solved (EthSwitch), P2B (Pay-to-Merchant) remains fragmented. A unified QR standard is the next "Event" needed to spike Usage figures.
