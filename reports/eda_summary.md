# EDA Summary: Financial Inclusion in Ethiopia

## 1. Dataset Overview
- **Total records:** 61 (after enrichment)
- **Breakdown:** 32 Observations, 11 Events, 15 Impact Links, 3 Targets.
- **Coverage:** 2014 - 2024 (with forecasts/targets up to 2030).

## 2. Key Insights

### I. The "Ownership Paradox" (2021-2024)
- **Account Ownership** (Global Findex) only grew from **46% to 49%** (+3pp) between 2021 and 2024.
- This is surprising given that **Telebirr** and **M-Pesa** added over 60M registered users in the same period.
- **Hypothesis:** High overlap between bank accounts and mobile money, or the Findex survey methodology (demand-side) captures active personal use differently than provider-side registration data.

### II. Digital Maturity: The P2P > ATM Milestone
- For the first time, interoperable P2P digital transfers have surpassed ATM cash withdrawals (October 2024).
- **P2P/ATM Crossover Ratio:** 1.08.
- This signals a fundamental shift in the Ethiopian economy towards digital-first payments.

### III. The Gender Gap
- Account ownership gender gap remains high at **18pp** (2024 estimate).
- While male ownership is nearing 60%, female ownership lags significantly.
- Smartphone penetration and digital literacy are likely drivers of this gap.

### IV. Leading Infrastructure Indicators
- **4G Population Coverage** has reached **70.8%** (2025 proj.), but **Mobile Internet Usage** is much lower at **21.4%**.
- This "Usage-Coverage Gap" is the next frontier for financial inclusion policy.

### V. Event Sensitivity
- The market responded aggressively to the **Telebirr Launch (2021)**.
- **M-Pesa entry (2023)** and **FX Liberalization (2024)** are expected to have lagging but significant impacts on affordability and usage depth.

## Data Quality & Gaps
- **High Confidence:** Global Findex data, Operator reports (Ethio Telecom, Safaricom).
- **Medium Confidence:** Gender gap estimates for 2024, Smartphone penetration estimates.
- **Gaps:** Qualitative data on "Trust" and "Quality" of services are missing from the formal unified dataset.
